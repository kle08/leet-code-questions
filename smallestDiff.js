// smallest diff
// input - 2 arrays of integers
// output - an array of 2 values from each array that has the smallest diff between them
// the purpose of this algo is to determine what 2 values, 1 from each array to find the diff between them
// example [2,3,15,20], [40,30,25, 21]
// should return [20,21];
// best way to tackle this type of problem is to use the 2 pointer method
// compare each indexies to determine to move the poiter up on either array
